Hi, I’m Stephen Power 👋

📍 Ireland

I’m a final-year B.Sc. (Hons) Software Systems Development student at SETU, with a strong interest in backend software engineering, distributed systems, and building reliable applications. I enjoy solving problems, writing clean code, and learning how real-world systems are built and maintained.

I’ve completed a Software Engineering internship at ACI Worldwide, where I worked on enterprise payment systems used by tier-1 global banks. I’m now focused on preparing for graduate software engineering roles.
